Hello Comillitons to the Cloud Computing Course 2023!

Thank you very much for your interest and your time!

In this course we will learn about cloud working possibilities with the focus on remote sensing and geodata.
A basic knowledge in scripting languages is useful to read programming code. 
Learning a scripting laguange while working is probably, but you will also learn how to print "hello world!".
